---

## 📊 SPACE PROMOTION STRATEGY

### **Week Before Space:**

**Monday (Jan 20):**
- Announce Space at end of Session 1 summary
- "Stay tuned for special announcement..."

**Wednesday (Jan 22):**
- Official Space announcement post
- Tag confirmed industry leaders
- Pin to your profile

**Friday (Jan 24):**
- "Tomorrow 3 PM" reminder
- Share what questions will be discussed
- Encourage community to submit questions in advance

### **Day of Space:**

**Morning:** "Today at 3 PM" post
**2 hours before:** Reminder with Space link
**30 min before:** "Going live soon" + final reminder
**15 min before:** "Starting in 15" + pin Space
**At start:** Welcome tweet tagging all speakers

### **Post-Space Content Multiplication:**

1. **Immediate:** 5 quote-tweets with soundbites
2. **Within 1 hour:** Summary thread
3. **That evening:** Recording + transcript link
4. **Next 48 hours:** 10 short video clips
5. **Week after:** "Best of Space" compilation

---

## 🎙️ SPACE HOSTING BEST PRACTICES

### **Pre-Space Prep:**

✅ **Test tech 30 min before** with a friend
✅ **Prepare 10 questions** (use 5-7 based on time)
✅ **Brief co-hosts/speakers** on format via DM
✅ **Have intro script** ready (1-2 min)
✅ **Pin key links** to share verbally during Space
✅ **Assign someone to take notes** for summary thread

### **During Space:**

✅ **Record it** (announce at start for consent)
✅ **Time-box segments** - gently cut off if over
✅ **Elevate diverse voices** - don't let one person dominate
✅ **Read username aloud** before bringing someone up
✅ **Moderate Q&A firmly** - cut off rambling or off-topic
✅ **Summarize every 20 min** - "So what we're hearing is..."
✅ **Take note of quotable moments** - mark for clips

### **Space Roles:**

- **You:** Primary host, moderator, time-keeper
- **Co-host:** Technical support, brings people up, monitors chat
- **Note-taker:** (Can be off-stage) Captures quotes, timestamps key moments
- **Panelists:** Active participants, not just listeners
- **Industry Leaders:** Featured guests, structured speaking time

---

## 🔥 ENHANCED PROGRAM VALUE WITH SPACES

### **What Spaces Add:**

1. **Credibility Boost** - Industry leaders validate your framework
2. **Content Arsenal** - 90-120 min becomes dozens of clips/quotes
3. **Network Expansion** - Leaders' audiences discover you
4. **Real-Time Engagement** - Creates event mentality
5. **Accessibility** - Audio learners can participate
6. **Evergreen Asset** - Recording lives on forever
7. **Media Mentions** - "As discussed in the X Space..." citations

### **Metrics to Track:**

- Live listener peak count
- Total unique listeners
- Recording plays (first 7 days)
- Speakers' repost/engagement with Space content
- New followers from Space participants
- Mentions of Space in subsequent conversations

---

## 💡 FINAL RECOMMENDATION

### **Go with OPTION 3: Dual Spaces**

**SPACE 1 (Jan 25):** Mid-program amplifier
- Smaller, more intimate
- Focus: Stress-testing Session 1-3 insights
- 2-3 industry leaders max
- 90 minutes
- Lower stakes = easier to recruit speakers

**SPACE 2 (Jan 30):** Grand finale
- Bigger, more formal
- Focus: Framework validation & launch
- 4-5 industry leaders
- 120 minutes
- Higher stakes = marquee event

**Why Both:**
- First Space builds credibility for second
- Can reference Space #1 insights in Sessions 4-5
- Industry leaders from Space #1 more likely to return for Space #2
- Creates two engagement peaks instead of one
- Demonstrates sustained momentum
