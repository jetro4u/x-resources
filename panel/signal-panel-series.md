## **1. SOCIAL SIGNAL: The X Algorithm Context**

### **What is "Signal" on X?**

Signal represents **meaningful, contextual engagement** that X's algorithm (and AI systems like Grok) prioritize for content distribution and recommendation. Think of it as the "semantic weight" of your interactions.

### **How X/Grok Processes Signal:**

Grok and X's recommendation algorithm use a **multi-factor scoring system**:

1. **Immediate Signals (0-10 minutes):**
   - Like speed (too fast = bot suspicion)
   - Comment depth (character count + question marks + @mentions)
   - Profile click-through (did they actually read your bio?)

2. **Short-Term Signals (10 min - 24 hours):**
   - Bookmark actions (highest intent signal)
   - Quote tweet quality (original analysis vs echo)
   - Reply threading depth (1 comment vs 3-turn conversation)

3. **Long-Term Signals (24 hours - 30 days):**
   - Follow retention rate (do people stick around?)
   - Mutual engagement loops (A ↔ B consistent interactions)
   - Content clustering (your posts form coherent topic graphs)
   - Citation frequency (others linking/mentioning you)

4. **Network Authority Signals:**
   - **Verified follower ratio:** Premium/Premium+ followers weighted 3x
   - **Domain expertise markers:** Keywords in bio + post history coherence
   - **Cross-platform citations:** Links from Substack, LinkedIn, blogs
