Just like soccer, one weak position collapses the entire formation.\" — Marcus\n\n**Tactical Insight**: The 5-3-2 is the default formation, but X dynamically shifts to 4-4-2 (more engagement-focused) for trending topics or 5-4-1 (defensive) for controversial content.",

One mute/block action might drop you 10%, but 10 actions = 30-50% permanent reach loss.\"\n- **Elena**: \"I tested this — posted borderline content, got flagged, lost 60% reach for a month.

Have you tried [related tactic]?\" (+75)\n  - User: \"Not yet, how does it work?\"\n  - Marcus: \"[Explanation]. Let me know if you test it\" (+75)\n  - [3-5 turn thread = 225-375 signal boost]\n\n**Elena's Tiki-Taka**:\n- Coordinate with 2-3 creators to cross-reply on each other's threads\n- Result: Network effect — your replies boost their reach, their followers discover you\n- Caution: Don't spam — 1-2 coordinated threads/week max",
